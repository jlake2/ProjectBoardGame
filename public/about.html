		<h1 id="about-title">This is a user-aggregated board game.</h1>
		<br>
		<p id="about-text">
			The point of the game is to move around the board 1 time.  Users submit their ideas for the best cards, and everyone can vote on the cards they think are the best.  
			<br>
			<br>
			Submitted cards start with a score of 1.  Once the cards hit a score of -5, they are no longer used.
			<br>
			<br>
			I've worked to bring two things I love to this website: user-aggregated content and boardgames.  I hope you enjoy! Please submit any bugs or comments to projectbgame@gmail.com
