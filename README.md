Project: BoardGame

This is a website I'm making in my free time.  It's a user-aggregated card-based board game. 

There are 4 players.  Users draw cards, and then perform the action on the card.

Cards are submitted by users, and every card can be voted on by users. 

The best cards are played more often; bad cards get weeded out and are played less often.
